Hello ! 

This is a collection of shaders that I stared to learn GLSL. I hope they are helpful and anyone is free to do as they like with them

Project files for xCode on mac but it's based off of the shader example in apps/examples/

Examples : 
simpleFragShader/ - changes the color of text based on mouse 
toonShader/ - limiting the renderable color palette ( basic toon shader )
lightingExample/ - light with ambient and diffuse. Specular is next !

//TO-DO In the future
Fog 
Depth / Depth of Field 
Bloom Effect
CubeMap
